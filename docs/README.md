## Programmatic Exercises

The Programmatic Exercises begin by walking you through the process of moving a Visualforce page into Lightning Experience, tackling styling updates to make the page look like it belongs in Lightning Experience. You'll also learn how to use a Visualforce page as a "piece" of a customized Lightning Record page. Finally, you'll learn the basics of building a Lightning Component, then move on to building a Lightning Component to replace the functionality of the embedded Visualforce page.
